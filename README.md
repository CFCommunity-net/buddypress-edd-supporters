#BuddyPress Give

BuddyPress EDD Supporters is an extension created for CFCommunity.net: A Social Network for people affected by Cystic Fibrosis (read more here: http://igg.me/at/cfcommunity/x). With BuddyPress Give we want to make it as easy as possible to accept and integrate donations for your BuddyPress community through the GiveWP.com plugin 

## Requirements

- BuddyPress
- GiveWP (https://givewp.com
- Paypal Payments Standard (include with Give)

### Recommended Give add-ons
- Recurring Payments
- Stripe


## Why do we need this plugin?

CFCommunity is dependant on donations of our users and to collect funding after the initial launch of our community, we needed a (recurring) donation system. GiveWP is the perfect fit. 


## Base Features
- Add Public Donations to the activity stream
- Add a badge to a user avatar when they are a recurring donator
- Show the donations that have been made on a users profile (members/bowe/donations/)
- Allow users to donate on behalf of someone else (including picture + message)
- A custom member directory of active donators.

## Exciting Ideas for the future
- Allow individual groups to accept donations (with PayPal/Stripe split payments to the main account)
- Allow Groups to collect donations together showing total donations collected from all group members
- Allow super quick micro donations in Multisite networks (showing donate buttons on blogs in the network)
